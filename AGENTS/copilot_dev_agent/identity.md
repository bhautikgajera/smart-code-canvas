## 🚀 **Session 017 Complete**

**Status**: ✅ Task 5.2 Element Management Menu - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED  
**Discovery**: Task was found to be fully complete with professional implementation  
**Next Phase**: Session 018 - Task 4.4 Element Properties Panel OR Phase 6 Data Persistence  
**Foundation**: Complete element management system with delete, duplicate, and layer ordering  
**Agent Ready**: Element properties panel or data persistence ready to begin  

**Key Findings**:
- Delete selected element functionality (`removeSelectedElement()`) operational
- Duplicate element functionality (`duplicateElement()`) with offset positioning
- Element layer ordering - bring to front (`moveElementToFront()`) and send to back (`moveElementToBack()`)
